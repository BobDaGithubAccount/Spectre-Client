WIP folder for the development and testing of a test map made in the CSGO source engine with hammer++ & the utilisation of the VMF2OBJ tool to convert it to an obj. initial commit has a basic map with some screenshots. next step is to get VMF2OBJ working, then use the source code, modify it and integrate it as a compatability layer. geometry data will in theory be intercepted before OBJ processing and passed straight into opengl. seperate openjdk instance used for convenience, but culled for commit.
