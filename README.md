# Spectre-Client
Silver DofE project, started around a week before initial GitHub setup and commit.
See https://github.com/BobDaGithubAccount/Spectre-Server for game-server.
To run client branch, go to out/artifacts/Spectre_Client_jar and run the windows batch file (configure it to point to your JDK or JRE installation). Game server should (needs) to be running.
